## Tradition born in our hometown

Piella Bakery is a family workshop that has preserved the same way of working for several generations. We believe in time, slow fermentation and respect for good ingredients.

### 🍞 We make things the way they used to be made

We are never in a hurry when working with dough. Our recipes come from old notebooks, stained with flour and filled with stories told around wooden counters.

### 🥐 Because quality needs time

In an age of immediacy, we still believe in letting a croissant rest overnight and in keeping a living sourdough that has been with us for many years.

### 🎂 A legacy we want to share

Every product that leaves our bakery carries a piece of our heritage. And every customer who enjoys it becomes, in a way, part of our story.
