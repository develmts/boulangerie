    "allergensAnswer": "In each product description we indicate the main allergens (gluten, lactose, nuts, eggs, etc.). If you have any intolerance or specific dietary need, we recommend mentioning it when placing your order or contacting us before confirming it. We’ll do our best to adapt where possible.",
    "pickupTimeQuestion": "When can I come to collect my order?",
    "pickupTimeAnswer": "Orders can be collected at the shop during the opening hours shown on the contact page. Once your order is confirmed, we’ll also let you know the recommended day and time slot for collection, especially for cakes and larger orders.",
    "changesQuestion": "Can I change or cancel an order once it’s placed?",
    "changesAnswer": "If you need to change or cancel an order, please contact us as soon as possible. For daily products, we’ll try to adapt if they haven’t been prepared yet. For custom cakes or special orders, changes may not be possible if production has already started."
